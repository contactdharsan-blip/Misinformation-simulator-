# Network-Amplified Misinformation World
# Based on network analysis findings (IEEE 8576937, Springer s13278-020-00696-x)
# 
# This configuration models a world where network structure strongly amplifies
# misinformation spread through:
# - Strong homophily creating echo chambers
# - High clustering creating resilient misinformation communities
# - Algorithmic amplification of emotional content
# - Small-world properties accelerating cross-community spread
