# Temporal Dynamics World
# Based on temporal analysis findings (PLOS ONE 0207383)
#
# This configuration models a world focused on temporal spread patterns:
# - Faster initial spread velocity
# - Earlier peak timing for misinformation
# - Slower belief decay (more persistent misinformation)
# - Optimized intervention timing
