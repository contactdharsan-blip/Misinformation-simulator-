# Community Structure World
# Based on community detection findings (Springer s13278-020-00696-x)
#
# This configuration models a world with strong community structure:
# - Tight-knit communities with high clustering
# - Strong homophily creating echo chambers
# - Information cascades within communities
# - Limited cross-community information flow
