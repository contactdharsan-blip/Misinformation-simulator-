CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

1. Neighborhood differentiation is working:
   - Neighborhoods with different education/income levels show different
     susceptibility to misinformation
   - Differences are visible in both adoption rates and belief strength

2. Key findings:
   - white_economic_anxiety: Low-edu neighborhoods show 35.7% lower belief
   - hispanic_immigration_fear: Low-edu neighborhoods show 53.1% higher belief
   - black_systemic_injustice: Low-edu neighborhoods show 14.2% higher belief

3. Truth protection mechanism:
   - By day 25, truth protection suppresses misinformation (as expected)
   - Differences are most visible in early days before truth protection
     fully activates
